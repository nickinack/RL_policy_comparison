# Policy Comparison in Reinforcement Learning
A study to compare between iterative RL methods and monte carlo RL methods using parameters like wall time, decay rate and policy map accuracy. The study aims to establish a comparison between the two implementations for a fixed discount factor.

The following files have been included:
1. Study description
2. Iterative Implementation
3. Monte Carlo Implementation

To execute and run these files, download and open them in your Jupyter lab/ Jupyter notebook

If you do not have jupyter notebook/lab, download them using the following code :
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```
```bash
pip install notebook
```

#### After installing , you may open your notebooks using the following command:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
